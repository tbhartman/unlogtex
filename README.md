# unlogtex

Summarize log of TeX

It undoes the mess of the log from TeX

## Introduction

Not much here yet, but this should eventually parse the log from Tex and output a summary of what happened.

Currently only pdfTeX output is supported.
There are several bugs I'm sure.
Oh, and not all warnings are parsed.  Yeah.
